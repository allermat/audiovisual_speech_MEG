%% How to (pre)process raw MEG data for the AV_speech study on the cluster %%

--- Start in Matlab ---

1) Maxfilter (NB: takes a long time!)
> open maxfilter_main_script_AVspeech.m in Matlab
> edit subject-specific directories and bad channels
> run (preferably using parallell computing)
> check that you now have .fif-files like "block1_raw_ds.fif"

--- Move to MNE Python ---

2) Set things up for MNE Python preprocessing:
> move data to M+EEG folder
> in MNE Python, cd into code/preprocessing

3) Concatenate blocks (concatenate_raw_AVspeech.py)
> edit the "subs" variable
> run the script in MNE Python

4) Fix EEG elextrodes (check_eeg_electrodes_AVspeech.py)
> edit the "subjfolder" variable
> run script in MNE Python

5) ICA artifact rejection (remove_artifacts_ICA_AVspeech.py)
> edit the "subs" variable
> edit the variables that determine whether to do MEG/EEG/both and ECG/EOG/both
> edit bad EEG electrodes
> run the script in MNE Python
>> if you get an error saying "No clean segment found", you might have missed a 
bad EEG electrode or MEG channel, so have a look in mne_browse_raw

--- Move to the MNE Python toolbox for Matlab ---

* Run mne_setup first! *

6) Find the subject whose head position is closest to the average 
(headpos_average.m)
>> NB: this means that you need to have data from all your subjects first!

7) Perform a "virtual headposition transformation" on all subjects so that 
sensor-level data can be compared more easily (trans_normalise_headpos.m)

--- Move to FieldTrip in Matlab ---

8) Segment data into trials (segment_into_trials_alltrig_AVspeech.m)
> edit subjPaths and run

9) Reject bad trials and sensors (reject_trials_stdev_visinspect_AVspeech.m)
> edit subjPaths and run
> check that the number of trials rejected looks sensible (not more than 10%)

10) Add in the lip and audio envelopes to the good trials (add_envelopes_AVspeech.m)
> edit subjPaths and run
>> the envelopes were made using the script resample_envelopes_AVspeech.m
